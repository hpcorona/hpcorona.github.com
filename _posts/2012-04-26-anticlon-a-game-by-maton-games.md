Well, i've been really busy because we have just released our first game.

It's name is Anticlon, and you can play it on Android or iOS.

People who know me, knows that i've been trying to make games since i
learned to program, but i haven't found a good team until now.

This is a big step in my life, because this is what i want to do for a living,
but there is still a long way to travel to achieve this goal. This is our first
game and we must continue developing more.

I have to say, both, Android and iOS are great platforms. Android being a little
more fragmented, but still, all are fun. Each day i found that a new device
is running Anticlon, devices i didn't knew about... We've had problems, but all of
them very easy to attend... Up to now, just 2 "big problems" related to the game 
not starting on certain devices, but, friends and family had been helping a lot.

I feel good. I feel relaxed. I feel that a new era on my life is about to happen.
Wish me luck!
