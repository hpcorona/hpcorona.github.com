Lately i've been thinking a lot about making a new NoSQL based project.

For sure, i enjoy developing new functionality for WinDev... So i started a new project last month: wongodb

What's wongodb? well, it's a MongoDB driver for the W-Language. It supports auto-reconnection, master-slave detection, replica-sets detection, etc...

It "works" now, and you can do "anything"... But in a very rustic way. That's why i'm not releasing it yet.

I'll be working on a better interface for WinDev, maybe work in something like H* functions but made for MongoDB to work with it easier. I'm just trying to find a WinDev-way to parse and store structure-less data in WinDev (maybe XML? assoc arrays?).

And maybe i'll make a new sample project based on MongoDB. Maybe a forum, i don't know yet...

I am also reading a lot from Redis... But i'm not reading the traditional docs, what i'm reading is the documentation to make drivers... I've found this way of knowing a tool very successfull, because you learn how the databases really work, and what can you do to optimise your data structures.

As of now, i'm in love with the way MongoDB works, and i've never made anything for real life in MongoDB, but for all that i've readed, i know that i can be a really good MongoDB database administrator...

Well, i've just have to express this.

So, stay tunned for the WinDev MongoDB drivers, they'll be out soon.
