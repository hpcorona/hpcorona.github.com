Ok, it's been a long time since i've created the first and second version of WD Easy SQL.

I've received LOTS of mails with happy users all around the globe.

Today i'll introduce you to WD Power SQL.

WD Power SQL is the same WD Easy SQL, but with a big boost.

And here are the changes...

## Not just for HyperFile

Yes, a lot of users requested it, and i haven't done it before because i didn't needed it.

But now, you can use connect to any database that WinDev can connect to.

Give it a try, and let me know if it is not working for you.

## Code Editor

Yeah baby!

As i told all of you, i've created WD Easy SQL to help me analyze data... So, now you can Write code inside WD Easy SQL, create in-memory Tables, fill them, and display a progress bar.

Useful to create processes to fix data or to analyze data easily.

Currently the code editor does not have syntax highlighting.

## Download it!

You can download it here:

Current version is: 1.50Ag

I'll be making posts on how to use the code editor... Right now, you can write code.

Hope you find this handy.
